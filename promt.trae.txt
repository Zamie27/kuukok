- Create modal interfaces for creating and editing portfolio items
- Handle file uploads through Livewire with proper validation
- Implement pagination and search functionality in Livewire components

### Security & Best Practices
- Implement server-side validation for all inputs including slug uniqueness
- Maintain CSRF protection on all forms without exception
- Escape all Blade outputs to prevent XSS attacks
- Use Eloquent ORM with prepared statements (never raw SQL concatenation)
- Implement proper authorization with auth middleware and role-based access control

### Code Quality Standards
- Follow PSR-12 coding standards consistently
- Add descriptive docblocks for all classes, methods, and important logic
- Write clear comments in English for complex logic and business rules
- Maintain clean, readable code with proper naming conventions
- Implement proper error handling and logging without exposing sensitive information

## Implementation Guidelines

### Database Design
- Create migrations with proper field types and constraints
- Add indexes on frequently queried fields (slug, status, published_at)
- Implement soft deletes if specified in requirements
- Set up proper foreign key relationships with cascade options
- Include timestamps for audit trail purposes

### Route Structure
- Create public routes for portfolio listing and detail views
- Implement admin routes with proper authentication and authorization
- Use route model binding for clean URL structure
- Implement proper HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Create SEO-friendly URLs using slugs

### View Architecture
- Organize views into logical directories (portfolio, admin, components)
- Create reusable Blade components for common elements
- Implement proper layout inheritance with consistent styling
- Ensure responsive design across all device sizes
- Maintain accessibility standards throughout

### Testing & Documentation
- Write unit tests for Portfolio model and business logic
- Create feature tests for CRUD operations and admin functionality
- Generate comprehensive documentation including installation guide
- Provide Windows-specific setup instructions and commands
- Create user guide for CMS administration

### Asset Management
- Configure TailwindCSS with DaisyUI plugin and custom themes
- Set up proper asset compilation with Laravel Mix or Vite
- Implement efficient loading of CSS and JavaScript resources
- Organize images and media files in structured directories
- Configure proper caching strategies for static assets

## Security Implementation

### Input Validation
- Validate title for required field and length constraints
- Ensure slug uniqueness across the system
- Validate tags as proper JSON array format
- Check gallery files for type, size, and quantity limits
- Sanitize all user inputs before database storage

### Access Control
- Protect all admin routes with authentication middleware
- Implement role-based permissions for different admin levels
- Prevent unauthorized access to unpublished content
- Secure file uploads with proper directory permissions
- Implement rate limiting for public endpoints

### Error Handling
- Create user-friendly error messages for validation failures
- Log errors appropriately without exposing system details
- Implement proper 404 handling for missing portfolio items
- Provide graceful degradation for missing images or assets
- Handle edge cases like duplicate slugs or file upload failures

When building the portfolio CMS, always prioritize security, maintainability, and user experience. Ensure all features work seamlessly together while following Laravel best practices and maintaining clean, well-documented code. Test thoroughly on Windows environment and provide clear documentation for setup and usage.
